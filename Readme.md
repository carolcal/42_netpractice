#Netpractice

This project is your first introduction to networking at 42 School.
You will need to solve 10 levels of network exercises and submit your solutions. During the evaluation, you’ll be asked to solve 3 random levels in front of the evaluator.

When I started this project, I studied everything related to the subject: TCP/IP, private and public networks, subnet masks, loopback addresses, switches, and more. Once I felt confident enough in my theoretical understanding, I decided to tackle the exercises.

That’s when I realized why it’s called Netpractice—because you really need to practice, my friend. Maybe you already have some networking knowledge, or perhaps you’ll find it easy. That wasn’t the case for me. Even though I thought I understood the theory, I struggled to solve the exercises without seeing how others approached them.

In this README, I’ll break down the networking theory needed to solve each exercise—so you can tackle the problems yourself. People learn in different ways, and maybe this will help someone else.
